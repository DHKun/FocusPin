# Changelog

All notable changes to FocusPin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Light/dark theme toggle in the titlebar (follows system by default; manual choice persisted)
- Store seam (`src/store`): user data now lives in a real file (`focuspin.json` via tauri-plugin-store) with idempotent migration from the old localStorage data; vitest contract and migration tests
- WindowChrome module (Rust): `set_pinned` / `pin_supported`; macOS vibrancy + Accessory activation policy
- Linux packaging targets: AppImage, deb, rpm

### Changed
- Full visual redesign informed by Things 3 / Linear / Raycast / Apple HIG / Fluent research: single frosted panel (high-opacity tint + sheen + noise), Things-style sections with whitespace, one-accent-per-screen discipline, inline SVG icons instead of emoji
- TodoList and Inspiration merged into one configurable `ItemList` module; item `createdAt` stored as ISO 8601 string
- All styling consolidated into design tokens + component classes (zero inline styles)

### Fixed
- Startup crash on NVIDIA + Wayland (WebKitGTK DMA-BUF, "Error 71"): auto-set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`
- Window transparency destroyed by CSS `color-scheme` on WebKitGTK; stale-paint ghosting when switching themes
- Window drag falsely triggered by clicks on SVG icons inside buttons

### Removed
- Four dead components (SettingsPanel, ThemeToggle, GlobalShortcut, ExportButton), unused global-shortcut plugin, `test.html`
